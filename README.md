# Prediction-Of-Cardiac-Arrhythmia
Machine Learning project to predict heart diseases


Cardiac Arrhythmia is a of a group of conditions in which the electrical activity of the heart is irregular or is faster or slower than normal. It is the leading cause of death for both men and women in the world. In this project, we plan to predict Cardiac Arrhythmia based on a patient’s medical record. Our objective is to classify a patient into one of the Arrhythmia classes like Tachycardia and Bradycardia based on his ECG measurements and help us in understanding the application of machine learning in medical domain. After appropriate feature selection we plan to solve this problem by using Machine Learning Algorithms namely K Nearest Neighbour, Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes and SVM .
